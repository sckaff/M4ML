# Math for Machine Learning

Intuitive jupyter notebooks and questions pertaining to the basics of machine learning! I have implemented an autoencoder (AE) from stratch and validated it with a PyTorch AE for my final project, classified the Iris dataset with basic Least Squares, reconstructed an image with Singular Value Decomposition, worked on wonderful questions pertaining to entropy (KL Divergence, Gibbs Distribution) and much more!

Overall, this is all my work from my favorite class at the University of Florida, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
