# Math for Machine Learning

Intuitive questions and projects pertaining to the basics of machine learning! Here you will find implementation of an autoencoder (AE) from stratch (equivalent to PyTorch's AE), classification of the Iris dataset with basic Least Squares, reconstruction of an image with Singular Value Decomposition, questions pertaining to entropy (KL Divergence, Gibbs Distribution) and much more!
